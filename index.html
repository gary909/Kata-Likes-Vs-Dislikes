        Story<br>
<br>
        YouTube had a like and a dislike button, which allowed users to express<br> 
        their opinions about particular content. It was set up in such a way that <br>
        you cannot like and dislike a video at the same time. There are two other <br>
        interesting rules to be noted about the interface: Pressing a button, <br>
        which is already active, will undo your press. If you press the like button<br>
         after pressing the dislike button, the like button overwrites the previous <br>
         "Dislike" state. The same is true for the other way round.<br>
         <br>
        Task<br>
        <br>
        Create a function that takes in a list of button inputs and returns the <br>
        final state.<br>
        <br>
        Examples<br>
        <br>
        likeOrDislike([Dislike]) => Dislike<br>
        likeOrDislike([Like,Like]) => Nothing<br>
        likeOrDislike([Dislike,Like]) => Like<br>
        likeOrDislike([Like,Dislike,Dislike]) => Nothing<br>
        <br>
        Notes<br>
        <br>
        If no button is currently active, return Nothing.<br>
        If the list is empty, return Nothing.<br>
